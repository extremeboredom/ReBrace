ReBrace works in conjunction with ThisService to add an option on the OS X services menu that processes selected code to put the opening braces in the correct place (on a new line).

To use you'll need to install ThisService from http://wafflesoftware.net/thisservice/ and grab a clone of the ReBranch script.
Run up ThisService and you'll see the option to Create a Service:
	Give it a name (I suggest ReBrace)
	Choose the rebrace.rb script you grabbed from the repo.
	Pick the 'Filter' type
	You can either copy the script in the include, or if you have put the script somewhere sensible just choose reference, then you can simply pull in any future changes.
	Hit Create Service.
	Additionally, if you are on Snow Leopard, you need to enable the Service in System Preferences:
		Open up Keyboard Preferences in System Preferences.
		Head over to the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.
		Select Services from the table.
		Scroll to the Text section to find the ReBrace (or whatever you called it) item, and tick the checkbox.
		
Now it is ready to use. Simply select some code you want to re-brace in your editor, and use the Services menu (it'll be in the right-click menu or in the Application menu on the main menu bar) to run ReBrace.
